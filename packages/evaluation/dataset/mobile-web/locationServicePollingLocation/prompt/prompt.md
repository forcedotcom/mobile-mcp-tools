Develop a Lightning Web Component (LWC) for an iOS app that allows users to track their movement by logging their location at regular intervals. Use the LocationService to periodically get the user's geolocation with high accuracy. Implement a feature that stores logged coordinates in a Salesforce object. Ensure that the location updates are stored only when the app is in the foreground. Use the `getCurrentPosition` method with `enableHighAccuracy` set to true. Handle permission requests and location service errors gracefully. The target device is an iOS smartphone.
