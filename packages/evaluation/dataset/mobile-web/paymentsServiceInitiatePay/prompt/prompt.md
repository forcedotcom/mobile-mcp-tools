Implement a Lightning Web Component for a mobile device (platform agnostic) that uses the PaymentsService to process a payment. The component should first use the getSupportedPaymentMethods method to determine which payment methods are available, and then provide a user interface that lets the user select a payment method (e.g., Tap to Pay or Credit Card Details). Once a payment method is selected, the component should initiate the payment using the collectPayment method.
