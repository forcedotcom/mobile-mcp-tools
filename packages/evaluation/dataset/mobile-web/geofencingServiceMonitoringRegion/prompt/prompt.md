Develop a Lightning Web Component (LWC) for an Android smartphone that uses the GeofencingService to monitor a region around a specified latitude and longitude. The component should prompt the user to allow location access if necessary and handle permission denial gracefully. Once the geofence is set, display notifications when the user enters or exits the geofenced area. Ensure the component is tested on a physical device to verify the geofencing functionality.
