Create a Lightning Web Component (LWC) for an Android device that uses the CalendarService to add a new calendar event. The component should prompt the user to enter the event title, start and end times, and optionally the calendar to which the event should be added. After collecting the necessary information, the component should add the event to the specified calendar and confirm the addition to the user.
