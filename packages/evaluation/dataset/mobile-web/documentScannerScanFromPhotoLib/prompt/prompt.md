Create a Lightning Web Component that integrates the DocumentScanner API to capture documents from a user's photo library on an Android device running Android 11. The component should support Latin and Devanagari scripts for text extraction and provide the option to enable entity extraction. Handle errors such as permission denial or invalid image input gracefully, displaying appropriate messages to the user.
