Develop a Lightning Web Component (LWC) that uses the ARSpaceCapture service to scan a room and visualize the scanned room's data (e.g., walls, doors) on a 2D map within the component. The component should first check the availability of the ARSpaceCapture service and display a warning if itâ€™s not supported. Upon successful scanning, extract and render the room data in a map format within the same component. Ensure that the visualization is clear and user-friendly, and the component is tested on an iOS device.
