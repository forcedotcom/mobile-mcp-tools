Develop a Lightning Web Component (LWC) that uses the AppReviewService to prompt users to leave an app review when they complete a task within the app, but only if they haven't been prompted for the current app version. Ensure that the feature is available on both Android and iOS devices and that error handling is implemented to manage scenarios where the service is unavailable or not enabled on the device.
